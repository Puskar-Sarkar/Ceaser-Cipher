# Ceaser-Cipher
This is a program in C to implement Ceaser Cipher

The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## How It Works
- If the shift is **3**, then:
  - `A` → `D`
  - `B` → `E`
  - `C` → `F`
  - ...
  - `X` → `A`
  - `Y` → `B`
  - `Z` → `C`

## Features
- Simple encryption and decryption.
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Keeps non-alphabet characters unchanged.

## Usage
1. Enter the text you want to encrypt.
2. Choose a shift value.
3. Click the **Encrypt** button to see the encrypted output.

## Example
```
Input:  HELLO
Shift:  3
Output: KHOOR
```

## Live Demo
This project includes an interactive HTML page with JavaScript that allows you to try the Caesar Cipher in action.
